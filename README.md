  # Responsive Layout Approach:

    Screen responsiveness is managed using custom helper.
    it handle adaptive sizing, spacing, and scaling based on screen width and height, ensuring a fluid experience on all devices.
    UI was validated on low-resolution devices and emulators to guarantee usability even on screens as small as 320px.

  # Theming and Styling:

    Color constants are centralized in a custom AppColors utility, making global style adjustments seamless and efficient.

  # Widget Structuring Strategy:
    Common UI elements shared across screens are encapsulated as separate widget classes inside the widgets/ directory to promote reusability and maintainability.
    Components that are unique to a single screen are written as inline methods within the page for simplicity.

  # 🏗️ Project Architecture
      Clean Architecture Principles were followed to ensure high scalability, testability, and separation of concerns.
The project is divided into distinct layers:
  Presentation Layer: Handles UI and user interaction using Flutter widgets, state management, and routing.
  Application Layer: Contains use cases and business logic, separating it from the UI.
  Data Layer: Responsible for fetching and sending data (mock or real), including Firebase integration and any local storage operations.
